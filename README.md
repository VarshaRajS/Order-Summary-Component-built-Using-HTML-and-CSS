## Overview

  - This is a challenge I picked up from frontend mentor which is really helpful as you will learn alot of things as you are building it. The project is about building a Order Summary Component. This repository contains the code for the desktop design .

### The challenge

  Users should be able to:

  - See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

  - HTML
  - CSS 
 
### Live Link

  - This is the live link to the project
  ( https://varsharajs.github.io/OrderSummmaryComponent.github.io/ )


### What I learned

   The major thing I learnt while building this project is how to properly implement the CSS box model and how to code to display the different components to achieve the desired result using flexbox.

### Continued development

   In my future projects I would continue focusing on CSS flexbox and grids since I am not completely comfortable using them yet but they are necessary techniques that are required to achieve our desired result.

### Useful resources

  - ( https://youtu.be/SR5GxoFhIAU ) - This youtube video helped me alot to complete this design when I was stuck and it is a 2 hour watch  and can be really helpful if you are new to HTML and CSS , but if you are already familiar with these you can skip the introduction section and look up to the part where the actual solution where to the design is explained. I woukd recommend to try build it on your own and refer the video when you are stuck.
